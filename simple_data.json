        "input": "",
        "output": "Cogging torque is the torque that is applied to a rotating device when the device experiences resistance from the teeth of the gears that are connected to the device. Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The boiling point of water is 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F), at standard atmospheric pressure. When heated at higher pressures, water's boiling point increases. For example, water will boil at a temperature of 115\u00b0C (239\u00b0F) at an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar. At higher pressures, such as those experienced at the bottom of the ocean, the boiling point of water can be as high as 374\u00b0C (705\u00b0F)."

        "output": "King Charles II ascended to the throne of England following the English Civil War and the death of his father, Charles I. He was crowned in 1661 and his reign lasted until his death in 1685. Charles II was also a patron of the arts, working with some of the greatest painters and sculptors of his day. He also encouraged theater and sports and had an interest in sciences such as astronomy and natural history. Charles II was a moderate ruler who respected the civil and religious liberties of his citizens. He was tolerant of other religions and gave Jews and Catholics more rights in the kingdom. Charles II was also a strong supporter of the Royal Navy, which saw England increase its power in the world. He also promoted the development of industry and commerce, which helped to modernize the country. Charles II's reign was an important step in restoring the monarchy of England after the turmoil of the English Civil War."

This line of longitude cuts through the Isthmus of Panama and separates South America from Central America. It is approximately 800 km (500 mi) in total length and was completed in 1914. The Panama Canal is an important shipping route and serves as an international waterway connecting the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean."
